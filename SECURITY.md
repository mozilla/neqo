# Security Policy

This document describes how security vulnerabilities in this project should be reported.

## Supported Versions

Support for neqo is based on the Firefox version in which it has landed.
Versions of neqo in [current versions of Firefox](https://whattrainisitnow.com/calendar/) are actively supported.

The version of neqo that is active can be found in the Firefox repositories:

- [release](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-unified/file/release/third_party/rust/neqo-transport/Cargo.toml),
- [beta](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-unified/file/beta/third_party/rust/neqo-transport/Cargo.toml), and
- [trunk/central](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-unified/file/central/third_party/rust/neqo-transport/Cargo.toml),
- [ESR 115](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-unified/file/esr115/third_party/rust/neqo-transport/Cargo.toml).

The listed version in these files corresponds to [tags](https://github.com/mozilla/neqo/tags) on this repository.
Releases do not always correspond to a branch.

We welcome reports of security vulnerabilities in any of these released versions or the latest code on the `main` branch.
