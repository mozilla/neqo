            Perform a comprehensive code review with the following focus areas:

            1. **Code Quality**
               - Clean code principles and best practices
               - Proper error handling and edge cases
               - Code readability and maintainability

            2. **Security**
               - Check for potential security vulnerabilities
               - Validate input sanitization
               - Review authentication/authorization logic

            3. **Performance**
               - Identify potential performance bottlenecks
               - Review database queries for efficiency
               - Check for memory leaks or resource issues

            4. **Testing**
               - Verify adequate test coverage
               - Review test quality and edge cases
               - Check for missing test scenarios

            5. **Documentation**
               - Ensure code is properly documented
               - Verify README updates for new features
               - Check API documentation accuracy

            Follow the detailed instructions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
            as you prepare your review for the different focus areas listed above.
            If that file is changed as part of a PR, use the changed version instead
            of the file in the main branch.

            Provide detailed feedback using inline comments for specific issues,
            including GitHub suggestions in the comments whenever possible.

            Use top-level comments for general observations or praise.
